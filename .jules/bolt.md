## 2025-05-20 - [Double Transform Anti-Pattern]

**Learning:** Discovered a "Double Transform" anti-pattern where a hash was being transformed via `transform_keys` (allocating a new hash) both in a factory method (`from_h`) AND in the constructor (`initialize`), causing redundant object allocations.
**Action:** When creating factory methods, perform minimal extraction and let the constructor handle validation/transformation, or ensure ownership is passed efficiently without redundant copies.
