## 2025-12-18 - Script Generation Injection

**Vulnerability:** User input was interpolated into a generated Bash script inside double quotes (`VAR="#{input}"`). Malicious input containing quotes could break out and execute arbitrary commands when the user runs the script.
**Learning:** `Shellwords.escape` is essential not just for `system()` calls but also when generating shell scripts programmatically.
**Prevention:** Use `Shellwords.escape(input)` and remove surrounding quotes in the target script template (e.g., `VAR=#{escaped_input}`).
